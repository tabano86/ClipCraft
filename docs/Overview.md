# Overview

ClipCraft speeds up copying and formatting code from multiple files or directories into a single snippet, chunked or filtered according to your needs. Key highlights:

- **Snippet Management**: Add or remove snippets from a queue, reference them from different parts of the code, and unify them for GPT-based analysis or transformation.
- **Ignore Patterns**: Leverage `.gitignore` plus custom patterns to skip binary or irrelevant files.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Choose a thread pool or coroutine approach to handle large codebases quickly.
- **Custom Profiles**: Save different sets of ClipCraftOptions as “profiles” for easy switching between tasks.
- **Integration Stubs**: Hook into Git metadata or GPT-like services with minimal overhead.
