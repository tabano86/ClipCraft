# ClipCraft

ClipCraft is an IntelliJ plugin that lets you copy, format, and organize code snippets quicklyâ€”across multiple files or
directories. It supports concurrency (thread pools or coroutines), GPT integration stubs, a snippet queue, chunking,
ignoring files/folders (including `.gitignore`), and a live preview in settings.

## Features

- **Concurrency Modes**
  Choose between disabled, thread pool, or Kotlin coroutines to process files in parallel.

- **Chunking & Overlap**
  Split code by size or methods. Ideal for GPT-based flows, large code generation, or partial refactors.

- **Directory & File Ignores**
  Automatic `.gitignore` usage, plus custom ignore patterns or folder-level ignoring.

- **GPT Integration (Stubs)**
  Send snippet text plus a prompt to a GPT-based service (mocked for demonstration). Great for code explanation or quick
  generation.

- **User-Friendly UI**
  A dedicated settings page with chunk/overlap preview, plus a snippet queue window, wizard for initial setup, and
  multiple actions in the context menus.

- **Additional Goodies**
  Pre-commit Git hooks (for Conventional Commits) set up by default, code style checks, Detekt for static analysis, and
  Spotless for code formatting.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the Plugin**
    - Build the plugin using Gradle, or download the latest release from JetBrains Marketplace (if available).

2. **Open Settings**
    - Go to `Settings > Tools > ClipCraft`.
    - Configure concurrency, chunking, ignore patterns, etc.

3. **Use ClipCraft Actions**
    - Right-click in the Project panel or Editor, then select **ClipCraft Copy** or **ClipCraft Submenu** actions.
    - Or use the dedicated snippet queue or GPT chat tool window.
